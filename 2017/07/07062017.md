#### Defining classes in C++
  * First, define the class itself by writing the following at the top of a file:
  ```c++
  class Template {
  }
  ```
  * Make a function prototype definitions and publicly accessible data members under the `public:` heading.
  * The class definition and prototypes go into the header file and the actual method bodies will go in the `.cc` file.
