* Address of operator: `&`
  * Similar to Go-lang, returns a pointer that points to an address in memory.
* Functions
  * You can declare functions at the top of a file with a *function prototype*:
  ```c++
    void fnWithNoReturn();
  ```
* Pointers
  * When you change the value of a variable that a pointer references, the pointer will reflect that change.
  * First, you can declare a pointer variable by placing an asterisk directly after a type and then providing a name:
  ```c++
    string* aNamePtr;
  ```
  * Then, you can set the pointer variable equal to the address of the object that's held in memory (by using the `&`):
  ```c++
    string* aNamePtr;
    string name = "David";
    aNamePtr = &name;
  ```
  * Finally, data at the address pointed to by the pointer can be accessed by using the dereference operator (`*`)
  ```c++
    string* aNamePtr;
    string name = "David";
    aNamePtr = &name;

    std::cout << *name << cout::endl;
  ```
* Passing pointers as arguments to functions
    * Ensure that the function signature allows for pointers:
    ```c++
    void acceptMe(string* name) {
      // ...  
    }
    ```
    * The above function accepts a pointer to a string as it's one and only parameter.
    * If you want to call a member function on a pointer there are one of two ways to do so:
    ```c++
    string* pStreetName = "Bleecker St."

    // Using the arrow operator
    pStreetName->replace(...);

    // Using the member access operator
    (*pStreetName).replace(...);
    ```
